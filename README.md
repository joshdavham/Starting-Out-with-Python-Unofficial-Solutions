# Starting-Out-with-Python-Unofficial-Solutions

This repository includes my personal solutions to the Programming Excercises from the 2nd edition of Tony Gaddis's *Starting Out with Python*. 

I include all my solutions from chapters 2-13, excluding chapter 1, chapter 14 and any excercises requiring access to the book's companion website. Chapter 1 was excluded because chapter 1 has no Programming Excercises and chapter 14 -- *GUI Programming* -- was excluded because, at the time, I was using this textbook purely for learning the basics of python programming rather than for learning about GUI's. There were a total of 7 excercises that were excluded because they required access to the book's companion website; they were: questions 5, 7, 8, 9 from chapter 8, questions 6, 7 from chapter 9, and question 7 from chapter 10.

Overall, I found this book immensely useful for learning the basics of python.
